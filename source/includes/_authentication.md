# Authentication

We use a token based system to manage authentication. You will have access to two keys.

- **Public Keys** (ideal for reading data and sites that cannot use server side scripting)
- **Private Keys** (these provide a higher level of API access with advanced posting)

See the image below showing the key locations. --

# Obtaining a key

Each Stack will hold **containers** and will also have its own Public/Private Key. You can click the cog icon on the stack and you can then see your Keys.

If you like you can regenerate a key and also restrict what urls can access the data.
